1. **Analyze**: Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes.
2. **Context Check**: Look for an `AGENTS.md` file in the root directory.
3. **Commit Rule Selection**:
   - IF `AGENTS.md` contains specific commit rules, follow them strictly.
   - ELSE (or if no specific rules are found), use **Conventional Commits** format.
4. **Conventional Commits Standard** (Fallback):
   - Use types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`.
   - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (Subject in Japanese if not specified).
   - Provide a body explaining the "Why" if the change is significant.
5. **Output**:
   - Show the proposed message.
   - Show the command: `git commit -m "[message]"`
   - Ask: "Apply this commit? (y/n)"
